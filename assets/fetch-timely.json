[{"text": "PSA\nHi everyone! We decided to take a break for the summer after today. We\u2019ve had an incredible journey this year. Along the way, we\u2019ve learned how to help create a place for the MIT community, but also made mistakes from time to time. We will learn from our mistakes and do better when we come back from our break. Thank you for your patience and understanding!\nWe hope you all have a great summer! To those who are graduating, congratulations! We\u2019ll see you all in the Fall, on the first day of classes.\nSincerely,\nMIT Timely Confessions\nP.S.

It was a barbecue at a MUN upperclassman's house, and my crush was playing cornholes on the lawn. I remember the moment he introduced himself- I was immediately in awe. His looks, his personality, his background and interests...everything was so perfect. Months later, we're at a MUN conference together. We're sitting on the side of a long table together during a team dinner. His friends were making fun of him for how he tries to pick up girls with literature...the irony is that I would love that kind of thing. Then he mentions a confessions post I made a while back about him- he memorized every word. He said he wondered who it was, and had genuinely no idea it was me. If only I could say something. It would be so weird if I asked him out after all of this time, right? I'm not even on his radar I'm sure...we don't have the same friends and the only time we see each other is MUN (that is a lot of time, but still).

I can probably be identified by the following description but whatever.\nI have at various times described specific plans to both my therapist and psychiatrist and was not committed. I told them that I fantasized of jumping off the green building; poisoning myself with alcohol while locked in my room with the door blocked off; cutting my carotid artery with a box cutter after gagging myself to muffle the screams; and stealing a dewer or LN2 from around campus, hiding deep in the tunnels, and asphyxiating myself. I clarified in all cases that these were idle fantasies, day dreams that I wish I could enact, but not things I actually had any conviction to do at this point. I clarified that I had none of the means for most of these (no knowledge of access to green building roof, no alcohol at the time but that\u2019s a low barrier, and no experience with setting a regulator or proper mask for gas asphyxiation). I did mention that I had two box cutters on my room, but prefaced that this was a method of last resort as it might be easy to stop midway through and attempt to save myself once the pain began given my lack of experience with self harm. I was asked to throw away the box cutters. They asked at the next meeting if I had, which I hadn\u2019t, and never asked again. I clarified that I only did superficial research into the subjects.\nI suppose in my case it was important to stress these were idle daydreams and that I lacked the conviction to make an attempt.

It's not just the DT study breaks because I've seen other student group parties/mixers and frat parties be just as crazy. And as the night progresses, things gets really uncomfortable. Some people get really aggressive with alcohol and other people become unable to care for themselves. Everyone, if you see a brother or a male friend become drunk and really pushy to a girl who isn't having it, get him away from her (suck up your ego and take the \"cockblocking\" comment later). Also, if you see a female friend who may have had too much to drink, stay with her and ask her if she is okay with any decision she is making and if she seem incapacitated of making decisions, take her home. Either way, control your drinking and if a friend is pushing you to get drunk and won't let you get away with it, that's the friends fault, not yours. Controlling alcohol use will not fix the sexual assault problem nor will it stop offenders, but it can help potentially prevent one. Please watch how much you drink and stand up for someone who has had too much to drink. Even if this wasn't the case with this past incident, I feel like it's important.

A agrees to do sexual activities with B. In the morning A \"regrets\" the sexual act. In this case they were TOO INTOXICATED TO PROPERLY MAKE A DECISION. We all know alcohol impairs inhibitory control. So A appeared to give consent to an act that, while sober, they would not have. At the very best A has had a shitty night with B. More likely B has taken advantage of A because B was able to make a clear and informed decision while A was not. And B is well aware of the fact that alcohol made A more likely to sleep with them because we all went through freshman orientation so if B didn't know before college they damn well do now. Both of these options suck. You don't want to be in either of these situations regardless of whether you are A or B. And if you are B you are responsible for A's assault because you (consciously or not) used a drug to make A more likely to let you sleep with them.\nNo one should have to worry about being taken advantage of sexually when drunk just like no one should have to worry about people coming up to them and asking them to sign contracts selling their soul away while drunk. Both of these situations are absurd and you shouldn't have to control how much you drink in order to avoid getting taken advantage of. \nSome people here have argued that it's impossible to expect that no one will commit crimes because there will always be robbers and murderers etc. And while this is true, THE VAST MAJORITY OF SEXUAL ASSAULTS are perpetrated by people known to the survivor.

Doesn't matter what crime it is, whether it's rape, theft, mugging, even car accidents sometimes.\nJust telling criminals to stop being criminals is wishful thinking. I mean yeah it'd be nice if we could just say \"Swiper no swiping\" and then all the murderers and rapists and kidnappers would just say \"aw man\" and become civil members of society. Problem is that's just not how the world works. If you're a worthless piece of shit who kills innocent people, you'll probably always be a worthless piece of shit and nobody will be able to change that. If you're so fundamentally fucked up in the head that you think it's okay to rape someone, then just being told otherwise won't make you stop. Criminals will always be criminals. Telling rapists to just stop raping is no more effective than just telling terrorists to stop setting off bombs.\nCrime is inevitable, so you should just do what you can to protect yourself. If you don't want your car to get stolen, you lock the doors and take the keys with you. If you don't want your house to be robbed, you lock the doors and get a security system.\nA great example is a 4-way intersection with a traffic light. If you're stopped at the red light, then it turns green and you go, but someone runs their red light and hits you. OBVIOUSLY it's their fault that the accident happened, but just saying \"oh it's their fault\" doesn't do any good if you're already dead. That's why you never drive through a green light without checking to make sure that nobody is about to run the red light. It's just common sense. Everybody agrees that you shouldn't just drive through a green light without checking first, but as soon as you say you shouldn't intentionally put yourself in vulnerable positions to be raped, everybody loses their mind.\nSelf-protection isn't specific to rape, everybody (men and women) do it in every aspect of their lives. I'm a man, and I still carry a knife if I'm out at night. When I'm back home where it's legal, I carry a gun everywhere I go. I don't walk around at night alone, I lock the door to my car and house, and I don't get myself so drunk that literally anyone could take advantage of me. Obviously rapists are at fault for rape, but that doesn't make it rational to go out of your way to make yourself the easiest possible target.\n", "date": "05/27/2018 8:56pm", "utime": "1527479775"}, {"text": "#7237 Why do I have so much junk to pack\n", "date": "05/27/2018 8:56pm", "utime": "1527479770"}, {"text": "#7236 Why I'm unfollowing all MIT confession pages: \n- because I can already predict the condescending and shortsighted comments by the SAME PEOPLE every time (you know who you are)\n- because I consider myself a liberal 100% and make no mistake, I detest the recent events that have happened at MIT, but I also cannot stand the tone of the dialogue around them\n- because when perfectly decent people post anonymous thoughts that question principles that ultra-leftists take for granted, most comments will be from liberals who, rather than respond to the OP's points and actually answer their questions, will comment with such superiority and hubris that it further isolates people with views and questions similar to those of the OP, acting to further divide the student body rather than bring it together\n- because the dialogue I see on these pages is stemming from the exact place that caused Trump to be elected; extremism exists on both sides, and when extremists don't stop to actually listen to the people in the middle, it pushes them in the opposite direction.\nI would really caution all extreme leftists to think more about *how* you respond to left/moderate concerns (on social media and in real life). Right now, the world needs more human compassion, and I am not seeing any at all on these confession pages. When an extreme liberal responds in an isolating manner to a more moderate liberal, it's usually just going to push them farther away from wanting to support the \"liberal agenda.\" (Some examples that I think are less black-and-white than liberals give them credit for: victim-blaming/safety precautions, trigger warnings, etc.) If you want to make a point, it is so much more effective to point out the validity in the other person's argument and then explain why it's not quite right, or to validate one part of an argument before disproving another part of it.\nI really hope my MIT community can find a better way to have these important discussions, and can at least try to put themselves in the shoes of others before they respond to confessions in such a harsh manner.

I'm someone with social anxiety, have never even flirted with anyone far less followed them around, have had silent crushes with painful outcomes, and now am afraid of walking outside, riding the bus, going to class, meeting with friends, and heaven forbid going anywhere near where she might be present (including events hosted by groups that she might be in, even though I'm interested for a totally different reason).\nIt is not sufficient to just say \"if someone is not a perpetrator, the investigation will reveal him not to be so.\" Sometimes there is no investigation. There wasn't with me. It was just slander. She didn't need me to be arrested or investigated, because she wasn't actually afraid of me and I hadn't actually done anything wrong. She used the rightful goodwill of society in believing her story (we should consider all abuse threats as credible, etc.) to her own advantage, destroying my confidence in the process. Many of you will comment on here saying that I'm a liar, and that is my point. Every woman must have her story treated as credible, and should have it investigated and resolved, both legally and in the eyes of the public.

Fraternities are not really a concept outside of the US and yet in the UK and Australia, for example, as many as 1 in 10 women report being raped while at university. The problem lies much deeper in our global society, and university campuses appear to be one of the more prevalent locations where this occurs. Whether it is dorms, fraternities, or all men's sports teams, I think there is this hot-headed, aggressive attitude that develops within some men when they find themselves among a large groups of guys that compels them to feel that they can take what they want from a woman, whether she agrees or not.\nSo, what if we just get rid of frats? Well, we would still have all men's sports teams and other groups of men who hang out together, and I feel that it is natural that among these groups, guys will sometimes objectify women when they talk together (\"XXX is so hot, did you see her instagram post yesterday...\" or whatever) and groups of women do the exact same things back to men, and of course men do this to men, women to women, non-binary to non-binary etc etc. However, my fear is that when it is a a group of guys talking about women, in a small number of cases (but nonetheless more cases than when this conversation occurs for women talking about men etc), there will be a man in the group who will allow this momentary objectification to grow into an overall feeling that they can do whatever they want to a woman they find attractive. Sometimes it takes alcohol to bring out these feelings, and sometimes it does not.\nI do not think that fraternities are the reason that men fundamentally do this more than any other group. All fraternities must want their members to treat women well and make them feel safe, first and foremost because that is just how people should be anyway, but also because the consequence of that not happening can be seen with TDC right now. (whether it was a TDC member or not who commited the rape, they are seeing the consequence of this reflect extremely negatively on their whole house). It has to be something deeper than that, something fundamentally wrong with our society that means that some men: (1) think that women say no to a guy to \"play hard to get\" and she really does actually want to have sex with him and he has to take charge to initiate sex and/or (2) extend the small levels of objectification that occur between every group from time to time into a deeper feeling that women are just objects for them to have sex with.

Victims want to get help, but they might feel personally responsible if anything terrible happens to the perpetrator or if a frat gets shut down. The threatening attitudes are not helping anyone. That is possibly why for the past Timely Warnings, the police don't have an ID for the perpetrator, because the victim possibly chose to not share it because he / she needs to do more emotional processing before he / she makes a decision as to how things should proceed legally. Timely Warnings are only made when a perpetrator is not identified to the police. Going to the police for an initial report or a hospital for DNA / STD testing etc. immediately is important for evidence for later for legal reasons, but emotional healing is also more important.\nAs someone who has been sexually assaulted in the past and have helped a lot of other people who had dealt with similar experiences, the best way to support someone who has been sexually assaulted is to provide emotional support, listening to them, asserting that it is not their fault, and turning them to resources like VPR, BARCC (the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center), S^3, and mental health.\n", "date": "05/25/2018 8:59pm", "utime": "1527307162"}, {"text": "#7130 I wanted to apologize for being a dick to you, but I thought you might still dislike me and wouldn't hear it anyway.

If I say those words, IT MEANS THAT I DON\u2019T WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU.\nIt is not an invitation for you to keep trying different things until I cave in because I\u2019m the least assertive person ever and I\u2019m not good at standing up for myself. \nI don\u2019t know if pressured consent counts as actual consent, but either way, it\u2019s still really hurtful and happens way too much.\nIt sucks that I had to be hurt so many times to learn that assuming people are decent human beings is not the way to go.\n", "date": "05/25/2018 8:59pm", "utime": "1527307150"}, {"text": "#7128 It's not surprising that someone got raped at a frat house.

This issue isn\u2019t about individual people, and getting rid of the perpetrator or even shutting down TDC isn\u2019t going to fully solve the problem.\nThis is the one case in which I think MIT should be more like Harvard. If the administration doesn\u2019t want their shiny reputation to get tarnished, it\u2019s way past time to get rid of every single fraternity on campus. Force them to decide between either being shut down or going coed, or if you don\u2019t want to take such a hard stance, do some kind of sanctioning a la Harvard.\nI live in a fraternity, okay? I understand how much value these living groups can add to the communities and their members, but there\u2019s no reason they should exist in a patriarchal, predominantly white power structure that insulates its members from a proper understanding of people of other genders. Anybody who doesn\u2019t think Greek life is on its way out in American society is fucking oblivious, and I would be incredibly proud of MIT being one of the first universities to get as far away as possible from these weird ass national organizations run by old alumni who don\u2019t have anything better to do than manage a bunch of frat houses, collect dues, and do their best not to wind up in the news.\nMajor props to the victims of the recent assaults for being brave enough to speak out, I\u2019m so sorry this is your college experience.

In what circumstances would these things be considered rape? A lot of things seem like an asshole move, but as far as punishing people for rape it's hard for me to actually draw a boundary. How much does the level of impairment impact things? What about whether the \"rapist\" knows the level of impairment?\nI think mental illness can cloud this a lot too. What if someone would consent while on meds but wouldn't while off (or vice versa)- what is considered the baseline decision? And similarly for someone who goes through depressive or manic phases. Is it rape to sleep with a consenting person in a manic episode? That's only half the story too. What if the rapist truly believed lucid consent was given, perhaps due to difficulty noticing something like intoxication (that would be obvious to a \"normal\" person)?\nIt just seems like we need much more descriptive language about this stuff.

I promise I don\u2019t mean to say anything here on a degrading way :(\nAnyways, on with the question. I\u2019m confused about gender identity. I understand that some people may feel as if they had been born with the wrong genitals and want to change over to the other sex. However, when someone says that they have a different gender identity but don\u2019t necessarily feel the need or want to change their genitals. For example, if someone who is a male by sex at birth proclaims that he identifies as a female, then are they just stating that they like to partake in \u201cfemale\u201d activities such as putting on make up, liking \u201cgirlish\u201d colors, and \u201cspeaking\u201d like a girl? I guess what I\u2019m asking is: do they find partaking in activities that are generally associated with female behavior fulfilling?\nIf this is the case, then why can\u2019t we just consider (sorry if this is politically incorrect) \u201chim\u201d a male that just likes to partake in female activities? After all, if gender is a social construct, what do people have to gain by becoming \u201ctransgender (in this sense)?\u201d Isn\u2019t that in some ways enforcing the very gender roles that the left is trying so hard to get rid of?\nTLDR; I understand the feelings of those who feel as if they have been born with the wrong sexual organs at birth. But when people talk about having a different gender identity or even having a fluid gender, what does that mean? Do they just like the social aspects of a certain \u201cgender,\u201d even though gender is just supposed to be a social construct and gender roles in an ideal world shouldn\u2019t exist according to the left?

To my fellow female friends (and some males), sexual assault is a crime, but we also have to be vigilant, aware of our surrounding, and aware of our own body at all times so that we don't put ourselves in a vulnerable position. Just like how you shouldn't walk alone in an unknown neighborhood, you should be consciously aware of how much you drink. If we need to shatter the stereotype that women are objects for men to bang, we need to be able to stand up for ourselves and that means not being impaired. When sexual assault happens, the offender is at fault, but if we are impaired and can't stand up for ourselves (i.e. if we can't even muster a \"no\"), we should recognize that as a major problem as well. I know it's college and MIT is stressful, but in my opinion, that's not an excuse to engage in an unhealthy drinking/drug behavior that damages us physically, mentally and sexually. The day that we shatter the perception that we are drunk and vulnerable and become strong and present is the day that people who are seeding doubts get defeated. I'm not advocating for prohibition of alcohol - moderate drinking is completely fine. But to engage in a \"you're only alcoholic after college\" mentality puts us in harms way. It's important for us to push for justice after sexual assault happens, but finding justice will never revert the pain and damage of the act. Stopping sexual assault means stopping the offender from causing the offense and stopping a potential victim from becoming a victim. We all (every member of this society) have to play our part and do better.\n", "date": "05/23/2018 8:40pm", "utime": "1527133248"}, {"text": "#7021 Holyyyy I just realized that one of my friends took SEVENTY TWO units this semester and she is a PREMED and she is probably going to have a 5.0 at the end of this semester I AM SHOOK!!

It means you are wrong.\nMany people weren't even supporting Trump, but were voting against the corrupt, the biased media, the usual \"politicians\" who never instigate any change, and against all the liberals who immediately shut down anyone with a different opinion and label them as a terrible person. And they won, not because they all thought that Trump would be a great president, but because they couldn't stand to see the extremist Liberals continue to thrive in their quest to make their opinion the only right opinion.

Saying that something is \"\"sexist\"\" or \"\"xenophobic\"\" carries very different connotations in different communities. Claiming that a perspective is \"\"objective\"\" means something very different in different communities. In some communities, ideological diversity is an accepted value and can be used as such; in others, whether it is important needs to be discussed first. Behind every post and comment there is a whole person with a whole philosophical framework and a whole personal lexicon we can't even see, let alone deconstruct over Facebook comments.\nToo many colleges are full of campus-wide shouting matches to see who can yell the loudest that they are being the most level-headed (I recognize that this criticism is mildly hypocritical, but it is nevertheless, I think, valid, both as a criticism of others and as a criticism of me). MIT was not like this for a long time, and it was really refreshing. MIT is really hard and that pulls us together and it's wonderful in a way that seems not to be found at many other colleges. Let's get back to that.\nI'm not saying the debate needs to end. But please let's not do it online? Talk about it with friends whom you trust and with whom you know how to effectively communicate. Talk about it with friends so you can spend time understanding their entire worldview as a whole and tailor your approach to that. Talk about it with friends who won't misinterpret your points as attacks, and with whom you can laugh and pset and support each other during your finals all-nighters despite your disagreement.
