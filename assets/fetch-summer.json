Hating on \"\"fat\"\" people calling them privileged won't solve your food insecurity issues. I'm finding it a bit hard to understand how can someone actually be starving at MIT, since there are MANY things you can do to prevent that from happening. As I don't know who you are, I cannot know what you've tried until now, so I'll just tell you what I did. I worked several part-time jobs simultaneously literally each and every semester since I came to MIT. If you're starving and not willing to do something like this, that's still okay, just bear in mind that you're probably prioritizing something else over food/health and then you're not more \"\"oppressed\"\" than someone who has food but works their ass off to get it. I didn't like it when everybody seemed to be diligently studying or pursuing their hobbies or just chilling while I worked stupid jobs, but at least I wasn't starving. Before you call me privileged or whatever, let me tell you that my family is so poor that it's me who's actually sending them money not to starve and that a good amount of the money I earn goes for expensive overseas plane ticket once per year to make my chronically ill mother a bit happier with my presence. And yes btw I probably have some extra pounds for whatever reason.

If you struggle being able to feed yourself, please seek out help, there are a lot of people trying to combat this issue on and off campus.\nPlease realize that not everyone gains weight because they eat excessive amounts of food. Actually, some studies by the NIH suggest that poor people are more likely to be obese than wealthier people because of lack of access to fresh/unprocessed food. So it's not as simple as being a \"\"Straight up rich ass people problems\"\". Weight gain is complex. What if a person gained their weight because of medication they are on, or hormonal problems, an eating disorder, or something else? Would you call them \"\"privileged as shit\"\" then? You don't know what someone is going through and you being judgmental and claiming they don't have problems because they gained weight is bullshit and makes you a true asshole.\nWhy can't people just recognize that abnormal weight gain and abnormal weight loss are just about equal problems and both can have disastrous affects on your health? For overweight people their is higher risk for diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and other conditions, it's not just about \"\"feeling uncomfortable\"\".\nI for one, have firsthand experience with weight gain due to an injury and becoming inactive due to a long recovery process. I developed problems with my back and knees to the point where I needed surgery and had to stop playing varsity sports. I never ate excessively, and didn't change how I ate after I stopped being active but I still gained 40 pounds and my doctor said I was at risk for developing type 2 diabetes. Sure I have realized that I need to change what I eat and I am working on it and changing old habits is hard, but does that make me \"\"privileged as shit\"\" because I gained weight and was upset about not being able to fit into my clothes anymore and upset that I might develop a serious long-term medical issue like diabetes? I wouldn't like to think so. People experience different levels of struggle with trying to change their eating habits for the better.\nI'm not saying that not having enough to eat is not a problem, it's certainly serious, but so is gaining a lot of weight in a short period of time. Trying to delegitimize people who struggle with weight gain are just as bad as the people who try to delegitimize people with depression or other mental illnesses. Though very different, both are serious medical issues that need to be addressed.\nLife isn't a race to rock bottom guys. You can recognize that 2 issues are problematic without attacking the person on the opposite side.\n", "date": "06/13/2018 8:59pm", "utime": "1528948740"}, {"text": "@233 my urop adviser forgot that i was working for her starting today, but im on payroll so now we gotta find a project to work on\n", "date": "06/12/2018 8:59pm", "utime": "1528862340"}, {"text": "#240 HELPPPP!!!

Yes, a non-white MIT graduate has less privilege than a white MIT graduate (even though I would argue that for example a Chinese MIT graduate has far more job opportunities in Singapore, Taiwan or China than a \"white\" graduate) but the average person, no matter if he/she is white, black or Asian, who goes to a less prestigious university or doesn't even have a college degree has it a lot worse. Even the fact that you live in the United States makes you far more privileged than 80% of people across the globe. It makes you also more privileged than white people who live in less developed countries like Ukraine or Russia.

What should I do?\nI tried cobbling up with a three-semester plan (with ASEs) and it just seems so depressing -- I first thought that my classes would be fun but now that I have to kinda rush my education it doesn't feel fun anymore. Plus based on my track record I probably can't do this; completed 36 units in the fall and 42 in the spring. I got a lot of advice saying to try it out with 5 classes next semester first, which I'll probably do but it would be tight, and I'm just too demotivated now to do anything.\nalso my confidence in everything is shattered after what happened this year. my parents don't seem to love me anymore after they realized that i'm the complete failure I am.\n", "date": "05/30/2018 8:59pm", "utime": "1527739140"}, {"text": "#40 Does SFS reduce aid on students who worked a lot in the past year, and intend to continue working that amount?
