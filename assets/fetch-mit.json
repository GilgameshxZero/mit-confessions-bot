I promise I don\u2019t mean to say anything here on a degrading way :(\nAnyways, on with the question. I\u2019m confused about gender identity. I understand that some people may feel as if they had been born with the wrong genitals and want to change over to the other sex. However, when someone says that they have a different gender identity but don\u2019t necessarily feel the need or want to change their genitals. For example, if someone who is a male by sex at birth proclaims that he identifies as a female, then are they just stating that they like to partake in \u201cfemale\u201d activities such as putting on make up, liking \u201cgirlish\u201d colors, and \u201cspeaking\u201d like a girl? I guess what I\u2019m asking is: do they find partaking in activities that are generally associated with female behavior fulfilling?\nIf this is the case, then why can\u2019t we just consider (sorry if this is politically incorrect) \u201chim\u201d a male that just likes to partake in female activities? After all, if gender is a social construct, what do people have to gain by becoming \u201ctransgender (in this sense)?\u201d Isn\u2019t that in some ways enforcing the very gender roles that the left is trying so hard to get rid of?\nTLDR; I understand the feelings of those who feel as if they have been born with the wrong sexual organs at birth. But when people talk about having a different gender identity or even having a fluid gender, what does that mean? Do they just like the social aspects of a certain \u201cgender,\u201d even though gender is just supposed to be a social construct and gender roles in an ideal world shouldn\u2019t exist according to the left?

It's important for MIT to provide good mental services that acknowledge the students problems and help them solve them. MIT can't possibly check up on each student when they don't show up to class, clubs, friend activities (otherwise, we'd be suing MIT for privacy violation). Also, it's not up to MIT to solve a person's mental health problem, that's for a trained clinician to do (otherwise, we'd all be saying it's okay to have a someone who is not a physician be your primary care doctor). Applying a slippery slope argument to MIT's court case doesn't help solve this issue (i.e. #13551). Also saying that MIT shouldn't prohibit contact between sexual assault victim and accuser and arguing that closing senior haus leads to more suicide seriously makes me concerned about your logic. Blaming Reif for every suicide also doesn't help students (#13550). In fact, if we keep on hating on the administration, it only makes those who are struggling less willing to seek out help because of all the antidotal things they hear/read. The onus is also up to us students to work with Reif and be reasonable. MIT already has pretty loose policies. Honestly, not many other school has an S^3 that is as supportive as ours (if they even have one), or the fact that you can drop a class one month before finals? Can MIT do more? Yes, but continue to blame MIT for everything you don't agree on makes me more concerned about your mental state than MIT's policies. Having so much hate never leads to good outcomes... Good mental health is also on the student to recognize when he/she needs help. And yes, from first hand experience, I know that's easier said than done. But not acknowledging your problems or refusing help makes it harder for someone else recognizing it and help you. MIT is there to support us, not coddle us. MIT is hard, but we also have to be okay with who we are and find help when we don't think we can do it alone (look, we all were the top of the class in high school and now, we're in a place where everyone else was also at the top). Blindly blaming MIT for suicides is unfair. We have to have a conversation, not a shouting match.

I'd also like to highlight the term \"\"vocal minority\"\". I too, was once upset to hear negative feedback on confessions about our ring (it will always happen) especially on things I personally put a lot of thought into. I entirely entirely entirely understand how the 20's might feel, but you should not neglect, invalidate, or simply brush off the negative feedback by calling it irrelevant altogether. You should learn from these comments, from both the good and upsetting.\nOne of our interview questions was literally how we would react and what actions we would take given overwhelmingly negative feedback.... and while I think the response this year certainly borders more on \"\"overwhelmingly negative\"\" than the historic \"\"vocal minority\"\", I'd understand if the committee didn't see it worth changing -- you can't make everyone happy. That's up to your discretion.\nI'm sorry 20's. I wish Ring Comm had a better mentorship structure where future years could get better guidance from the old folks. I would have loved to help or provide my feedback once or twice while I could, and part of me feels like I've let old Ring Committees down by not helping perpetuate a certain culture of design.\nMaybe the 21's will learn from the overwhelming feedback and change for the better.

I know I'm missing something.\nI feel like some parts of MIT's AI startup movement are misguided (and that MIT isn't doing a proper job of teaching ML and educating aspiring AI entrepreneurs). I say this for 2 reasons:\n1. MIT AI/Machine Learning courses are either very theoretical (focusing on the math / nitty-gritty of certain ML algorithms) or too broad (they try to cover a ton of ML concepts / essentially take you on a journey through how ML progressed). In other words, their primary focus is on understanding models, not building them.\n2. Building your own ML models is another challenge in and of itself, but to (over)simplify things, it boils down down compiling a large (possibly unwieldy) dataset and then applying matrix multiplications, loss functions, and backpropping. Compiling the dataset takes a huge amount of time (not to mention figuring out how to label them), and then tinkering a model to \"do well\" on whatever the initial goal was, then going back and forth between the two, takes even longer. Not to mention that much of it is resource intensive and will have to be done on AWS.\nMIT clearly believes in AI / Machine Learning (just based on the number of new courses and the IBM partnership). My concern is that MIT may be overemphasizing the wrong parts, focusing more on the ML models rather than the process of building everything (dataset and model) from scratch. (This could go into a whole other debate on whether its student's jobs to learn these things for themselves / whether internships should cover those aspects, but I'd like to focus more on how MIT is approaching ML).\nBasically, TLDR, MIT's way of teaching machine learning provides a good foundation for building 1-shot machine learning tools, not machine learning startups.\n", "date": "01/24/2018 11:01pm", "utime": "1516863694"}, {"text": "#11999 Hey neighbor.

All of my anecdotal experience points to MIT covering the people who need it, and the people I know not on financial aid, well, they live in giant houses and have been flying around the world all their lives; they don't seem to need it as much. Even the people I know who have gotten screwed at first were able to appeal and get things sorted out.

Is there some common theme to all these situations that is causing a lot of people to get screwed over? Some sort of anonymized dataset that could show how finaid correlates to income/assets/etc? Does MIT release any of that information? In addition, is there any sort of study that would show if it's more common for people on or off finaid to be going hungry? Is the issue that MIT isn't accounting for every situation, or simply not giving out enough aid across the board? I'm also really curious how the liquid assets of people on or off aid compare after you take out the portion contributed to MIT (or college in general in the case of multiple kids)? this seems like a number that should be fairly similar for most people, excluding those who make far less than the cutoff to start getting less than full aid and those who make far more than that cutoff + the cost of MIT); yet it seems like there's a lot of outliers.

A physics major is already pretty hard, and I'm pretty sure I have to study more than most other people to do decently well. Then doing the CS minor on top of that drains most free time I otherwise have left over (I also had no CS background at all, and worse math than most, so those CS assignments also probably take me longer). So then I'm missing out on other things I enjoy doing with my free time. But I feel like if I don't get the CS minor and a physics undergrad degree doesn't cut it (in case grad school doesn't work out, which might be the case right?), then a physics undergrad degree is meh and I might have not gotten as much of an improvement in my socioeconomic situation as I'd have wanted. So I feel like I absolutely have to study CS if I want to get a physics degree.\nThe alternative is to ditch the physics degree, study something more lucrative (probs CS), and take some physics classes I want to.

There\u2019s also Weinberg\u2019s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The TAs understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these explanations, to realise that they\u2019re not just logical- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Robert A. Weinberg\u2019s lectures truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn\u2019t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Weinberg\u2019s existential catchphrase \u201cIn contradistinction,\u201d which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev\u2019s Russian epic Fathers and Sons.

The biggest question I get now as a senior is why? Why despite being surrounded by reason did I make way for faith? There's a few reasons. The first is it makes logical sense from an odds perspective. There are two options there is or is not a God. You can choose to believe and worship, or not believe and worship. Lets say you believe and worship and there is a God. You get into heaven and it's eternal life, that's great. Let's say you believe and worship and it's all made up. Well you lived a good life, and it's not as if you can care anyway at that point. Let's go the opposite side of the coin, there is no God but you worship him, nothing happens again. Not a big deal, you lived a good life, and now you can't care after you die anyway. But lets say you don't worship, then after you die you go to hell. Now you are damned for all eternity. By worshiping you don't lose anything you can only win. Some people I know hate this piece from Voltaire, but it's tough to say it's flawed. The second is a greater need. A very clever priest pointed out to me that atheists had won and made America a secular society in practice. You can't possibly argue society is better now. Lack of faith has not given way to reason, as the last election pointed out. Look at the sexual revolution and culture change from the 60's and 70's. It's been a disaster. Divorce rates are sky high. People no longer look at their intimate partners as partners, but as trophies to be used and shown off who can be changed at will. Massive amounts of the population have turned to drugs to cope with the lack of emotional needs being met. We have essentially dehumanized each other. The big push backs to this are don't you care about peoples freedom and choice? Let me ask you this, should we be free to make our own choices on these matters? I say no. Most people, including us, when left to our own devices make poor decisions. The majority of Americans are now overweight for example, and have too much credit card debt, this includes the well educated. We can't even handle diet and budgeting. The other push back I get is we shouldn't be good only out of fear of punishment. That is true, we shouldn't have to, but unfortunately many people need that fear. That's why we have a system of laws as well. For 2000 years the western world has lived under a form of a strict Christian rule that produced a stable rising society. The idea that we can rule without it is brand new from a historical perspective and it's rather arrogant of us to think we have somehow learned more about logic and the needs of man then 2000 years worth of theologians and scientists, most of whom have done their work in the context of faith.\n", "date": "02/24/2017 9:02pm", "utime": "1487998920"}, {"text": "#9189 Why does MIT's AAA consistently have the most racist sounding events? \"50 Shades of Yellower?\" Last time I checked, no one is actually yellow unless they have something like jaundice.

I really want to believe that not as many people act apathetic because they really don't care but because they don't know how or why to care. If there are more opportunities to get involved and people understand how the system can create change in our lives then maybe people will also pay more attention. Whether its funding research, better healthcare, better STEM education, more opportunities and jobs, or just being able to feel like you have a say in the system that structures your life, politics isn't this just a thing that loud overly opinionated people do. It's a way of engaging your community and making it better for everyone. You can register to vote, help people register, get involved with MIT Democrats, Republicans, whatever you stand for, generally read news, learn about how things in Cambridge change and get changed, whatever it is you want to do to feel engaged.

But it's still so much better than how it used to be, when I tried to be a normal MIT student taking a normal 48 units while taking all the classes required for my major. I worked my ass off, got lots of help, went to office hours, went to S3, never slept, went to Mental Health and got a prescription for Adderall, generally did everything right and then some, and still barely passed my classes, assuming you count a D as passing. It sucked. Maybe if I went back to that lifestyle on my lighter courseload I could be an A-B student, but I was so fucking miserable, and it's not worth it. If a low GPA is the price for my sanity, I'll take it. My blood pressure dropped almost 30 points from near-hypertension levels back to pre-MIT levels when I made that transition. I refuse to go back.\nBut I still have to meet with my professor to talk about how to fix my apparently problematic grades, which was a shock because I was enjoying that class. For the first time I was understanding what I was learning in a technical class, and I got full credit on some pset and exam problems, which is also a first. This professor is so much nicer than other professors too. I'm so used to being treated with contempt by professors, but he treats me with respect and it's such a shock. I don't know what to tell him.

The idea is that if women want the same rights as men then we should serve along side men. And I realize that the draft is rarely used but this is isn't even about equal rights and using that as the reason behind this is fucked up. If it was really about equality, then the military officials deciding this and pushing for this bill should not be mostly men. And frankly if the military can't even ensure the safety of women in combat now, specifically when it comes to sexual assault, what do you think is going to happen if women are forced to be there?\nI am personally very anti-war and think no one should have to register for the draft regardless of sex. But if this is really going to be about equality, then I want the same men that think it is right to send women off to kill others and/or die to give me and other women the rights we actually deserve. Rights like full access to birth control, feminine products (without a pink tax), equal pay, and the right to decide what to do with my own body without the influence of government.\nI get that a lot of people may agree with this bill and I'm not \"anti-America\" for disagreeing with it. I just think it's wrong to use women's rights and equality as an excuse to force people to serve the military, especially when the military is not the only (or often even the best way) to serve your country. These men don't actually care about women's rights. If they did they would have done more about sexual assault in the military and other women's rights issues in the US.\nI'm just irritated now.

I am quite honestly astonished by the sheer number of Bernie Sanders supporters at MIT and other elite institutions of higher learning across the U.S.\nWhile I actually agree whole-heartedly with him on social and foreign policy issues, his fiscal and economic policies are as absurdist as a 1972 Luis Bu\u00f1uel movie. Not only would a 15 dollar minimum wage instituted at a federal level decrease overall social welfare but it would actually hurt the poorest people of the country the most. There would be much fewer jobs for American workers and more jobs outsourced. People that are willing to work for less aren't able to. Of course certain cities/ states can viably maintain a 15 dollar minimum wage which is why it has been instituted at those levels. Then Sanders goes on to say that he would be in support of regulation that would make it illegal for American companies to outsource jobs and would like to see an end to most of our free trade agreements with China, NAFTA, etc. This is almost comedic in stupidity. If that regulation was actually passed, companies would simply move out of the U.S which would hurt the economy even more. Tapping into the global economic ecosystem is crucial for American success in the future and it is a backwards view to isolate ourselves. Finally, at the crux of Sander's economic policy is the villainizing of the rich. It's clear through all the various debates that he views rich people as greedy, evil people that provide no value to society. This simplified and narrow-minded view is ignorant. Yes the previous recession was in part caused by \"greedy\" leaders of banks but from a higher perspective the actual problem was caused by mis-aligned incentives on the part of the federal reserve and U.S government. Additionally, the finance industry is largely responsible for the innovation and growth of the American economy throughout much of the past decade, which Sanders clearly doesn't know/ acknowledge.\nNo Bernie, I refuse to \"feel the bern\", and I would highly encourage fellow MIT students to consider the consequences of these fiscal/ economic policies thoroughly before blindly hopping aboard the hype train.\n-concerned MIT senior\n", "date": "04/24/2016 7:53pm", "utime": "1461552782"}, {"text": "#6053 What the FUCK did you just say about my hair?!\n", "date": "04/24/2016 7:51pm", "utime": "1461552712"}, {"text": "#6051 I want to sit on one of the four blocks at each corner of Lobby 7, but do not have the climbing skill to get up there...\n", "date": "04/24/2016 7:51pm", "utime": "1461552691"}, {"text": "#6048 This question may sound bad but please hear me out, I mean this in the least judgmental way possible: Why do Asians feel like they're underrepresented here?

If someone wants to stop, they don't have to finish a loop. Those enjoying it can even go out and back again. What do I wear when I show up? Clothes or a towel. Where do I leave the clothes? In Lobby 7, since that's where the run ends. Why doesn't the run go outside? Safety in the cold weather - even UC Berkeley stays inside. What about cameras?

MIT IS NOT WORTH DYING OVER.Yes, sometimes withdrawals are coerced (which, of course, is pretty concerning), but it takes a decent amount to get there, more than suicidal thoughts, if a low level of intent is expressed. And if you do have to leave, there is a decent chance you will be able to come back eventually. Plus, you can always see a therapist outside of MIT. No risk of withdrawal then :)\n", "date": "12/02/2015 11:00pm", "utime": "1449126010"}, {"text": "#3084 Why is it so necessary to have faculty that are similar to students?

I don't hide what I am, and most of my friends here are agnostic or atheist. We all get along just fine. One question I frequently get asked, I would like to address here. The question is, \"why doesn't your church do things to be more fun, accept birth control, cohabitation, female priests, and other serious changes\". People usually add to that how those changes would bring back young people in droves. Lets talk about fun, church is not meant to be fun. Church is about learning how to live your life, and to keep you on the right path. Lectures here are not always fun, but you still go, because you understand their need. People who leave church because it's not, \"fun\", are like people who leave lectures here they paid for, they missed the entire point. Next, accepting homosexuality, cohabitation, female priests, etc, etc. The reason we do not do these things is because all of these things are against the core doctrines of our church. We follow the lessons of the bible, the bible strictly forbids cohabitation and birth control violates the spirit of being open to life. We also forbid them because we empathize putting others before yourself, this includes creating stable working families, where you put the needs of the other members before yourself, even if it is at your own detriment. Cohabitation encourages you to seek your own pleasure, above the needs of others. (There is also plenty of psychological research showing this.) Some people have argued against this from a survival standpoint saying we should do it anyway just to get new members. We are not a popularity contest. Jesus when asked if he was king replied, \"My Kingdom is not of this world\". We are not a worldly crowd, nor do we want to be. And even if we were, the majority of students here at MIT would not show up anyway. You would all know that we were changing the doctrines in a cynical attempt to bring you. Did you know there are many new protestant sects that accept homosexuality, female priests, cohabitation, and other things? If you ask why you haven't heard of them it's because they collapse almost as fast as they rise. People stay faithful because faith challenges them, not tells them what they want to hear.

Either aboutsomehow \"accidentally\" getting back with you once again and putting myself into reliving the pain, or a combination of that and the last few non verbal encounters we had. I'll get over it eventually, they're just subconscious remnants of trauma. I just really hope you learned for your next relationship. Never treat someone how you treated me. Your last message makes me hope you did learn. You are an amazing person and even though I don't love you anymore I do remember why I loved you and I hope you can share that with someone else.\nI want to say the following because there's a chance it can help someone else: No relationship is worth emotional/physical abuse. Emotional abuse is very real, because there was no physical damage I used to think it wasn't real/wasn't really affecting me. But it was. When I see him now I get so scared, but not for my physical safety. I never thought this was possible, a conditioned fear reaction without (much) physical cause. I don't care how much you love them, how good things are usually, how much it feels like you can never love someone as much as you love them. Do not let them hold you hostage by your love. If they threaten to break up with you over something absurd in order to control you, let them. Call theyre bluff, youll see its almost always a bluff. If they threaten to break up with you, let them and say goodbye. Dont take them back, especially not if this happens repeatedly. If they say, \"if you really loved me then [insert something they want you to do/not do]\", realize there's a big chance they are trying to manipulate/control you. Never let someone try to invalidate your emotions or tell you they are wrong/not real. If you repeatedly argue with them about the same things, and its always them attacking you and you defending yourself, its probably not going to change. You'll make up, things will seem fine, and it will happen again. Leave them. Even if it seems like you can't survive without them, you can, you will adapt and grow and you will be so much stronger and happier because of it. Losing them will open room up in your life for so much more. Never let fear control you.\nIf you are ever confused or unsure about how you are being treated in a relationship, please ask for help, go to VPR. They can help you figure out what's going on, which is usually really difficult if you are blinded by love. Emotional abuse is so hard to deal with alone because even if you know youre in the right, having to always defend yourself really does affect you in subtle ways and gives them control over you. Literally the person I talked to at VPR helped me immensely, even though no one has ever been able to help me work through something before in my life. You are strong, you will adapt, and you are worth so much more.\n-2924\n", "date": "11/26/2015 1:21am", "utime": "1448529682"}, {"text": "#2978 I appreciate everyone who shared about their abusive relationships.

Eg. children only, though that would be heartbreaking for those families and not necessarily the best option for those children, etc.).\nTo argue that innocent refugees should be welcomed because they're decent human beings is to argue against a straw man (Well, it may SHOULD be arguing against a straw man, though some politicians' comments seem to indicate they might actually be opposed to this sentiment...). If governments had divining rods that could tell who was and wasn't intending to perpetrate violence on others, this decision would be much more straightforward.\nI just wanted to articulate this distinction.

Acknowledgment these differences publicly in the form statements above and jokes is OK, since people there seem to have objectivity sense and sense of humor. This calm attitude seems to be based on the fact that no ethnic group feels endangered and hence takes these statements/jokes seriously.

We've all struggled here-okay *most* of us for one reason or another. We've all questioned ourselves and the Institute for what it *claims* to offer.\nFor me personally, I've constantly struggled here. My freshman year I chalked it up to not having a strong technical background. I didn't take AP Chem or higher level biology and those were the classes I got my fifth week flags in. As I was getting adjusted to just how rigorous (read: how absolutely fucking ridiculous) MiT work can be, sophomore year came. Once again I was flogged by work. Now in my major I chalked up to never seeing the material before, but sophomore year I realized, just like most people realize sophomore year, that something is up. MIT\nmay be ranked one of the greatest schools in the world but you wouldn't be able to tell that by the quality of the teaching.\nSee, every homework assignment I've EVER gotten at MiT. I've had to google, I had to Wikipedia, I had to Internet. Every assignment required me to learn what ought to have been taught in class. The problems were never really elucidated by lecture. They just show where the hole is, and the homework throws you in. \nAfter a few years here I've gotten tired of it. When I see professors say \"you'll learn through the Pset\" I realize that's often a poor guise to cover their poor teaching. And as much as people may learn from really hard problems only loosely connected to the lecture, I don't. Relying on excessively hard problems to most of the value to your education is one size fits all solutions that fails to take into account people's differing learning styles or the fulfillment of the undergraduate experience. I learn from teachers. Not problems. Even if I did, with the constant rush to the next assignment or the next problem you don't have the time to dissect a problem for its moral of the story. Let's be honest, you don't even have time to sleep here.\nNow say what you will about MiT needing to be \"rigorous\" or hard, but in reality, I've spent years here just googling. Now googling Isn't inherently a bad thing , but when I find other universities with far better notes and lectures than MiT-constantly-I have my doubts about the Institute. \nI have my doubts when I see all of us struggling to get by, when I see suicide after suicide, and realize we are some of the smartest people in the world. Yet, collectively we struggle here. Yes, we came here for a challenge and yes struggling is a great way to grow, but clearly the struggle here is an order of magnitude off.\nGreat researchers don't always make for great teachers. And yes, the idea of having the best in the world teach you sounds great...but I realize being taught by the best *teachers* in the world would be a helluva lot better.\nI'm just writing this because I feel others can relate and this sentiment should be voiced\n~Holla\n", "date": "10/29/2015 11:07am", "utime": "1446142074"}, {"text": "#2341 I don't understand people who keep saying that they hate MIT and still stay here.

Why is your \"confidence\" based on being better than other people? Sometimes it is super annoying to work with another MIT student at a company because they often look their noses down at kids from other colleges and they refuse to learn from them. Like stop.

A lot of people at my high school didn't see it that way. They thought the way a lot of you guys think - they got their self-worth from being the best. And they saw her as a threat. They told her everyday that she was stupid and basically bullied her. My sister to this day doesn't realize how smart she is, how she has the freaking Midas Touch all because a few self-conscious people couldn't stand the thought of not being the best.\nSo how do I get my confidence?

However, if you aren't trying to save as many lives as you can every second of every day when you have the possibility to save them, then you are in some sense responsible for all of those lives.

That doesn't change the fact that everyone I've met here is amazing, but simply reflects the fact that we all have our own ideas of amazing. For example, the most amazing person that I know based on my standards of amazing is someone who always seems insecure/scared/inadequate for not having the best scores/stats/accomplishments but never fails to check in on a friend, which is a trait which I consider important enough to make them my most amazing. Similarly I've heard ppl consider someone who's gotten '200 top company job offers' (Clarification: That's intentional exaggeration) to be the most amazing.

But not with what I expected. I grew up in a poor family. My dad finished high-school and never went to college, my mom didn't even finish high-school. They had to work 12+ hour shifts 6 or 7 days a week at dead end jobs to support us. I escaped reality by throwing myself into academics and got here as a result. My friends here have been supportive of me but there have been times where we had to deal with different sets of thinking. For example, both my parents smoke, my older brothers also smoke, and they all smoke in the house we live in. When I casually mentioned to my friends that they wouldn't like my house since it smells of heavy tobacco they flipped out and asked how any parent could subject their child to it and told me that I was an \"abuse victim\". It took a very long, patient, explanation and I want to share it because I feel that a lot of the middle class and rich students here do not get it, quite frankly. Most poor people smoke and are now the majority of smokers. One big reason is poor people don't get weekends, or vacations to a beach house, or yacht club. For many of them, a cigarette is the only break they get. And some people say, well what about 20 - 40 years from now? When you are barely scrapping enough money to pay rent and put food on the table today, 20 years from now is as far from your mind as it can be. And about smoking in front of me, first of all, second hand smoke isn't nearly as dangerous as smoking itself, and if you read the studies, (I have quite thoroughly.) they admit you have to be around it in an extremely concentrated manner for decades to have any tangible effect. What I had, a few family members who would have a couple smokes after dinner at the table, does not nearly qualify. Also, my parents were both raised by chain smoking parents themselves, so this to them is very normal. What I ask my fellow students is to please stop rushing to judge poor people for not following middle class and wealthy people in lock step, money makes a massive difference. And please don't call me an \"abuse victim\". To compare people smoking cigarettes in front of you to a parent physically harming their child is insulting to people who have had to deal with it.\n", "date": "10/05/2015 9:47am", "utime": "1444063679"}, {"text": "#1918 I want an app that tells me where all the bathrooms at MIT are.\n", "date": "10/05/2015 9:46am", "utime": "1444063613"}, {"text": "#1915 Sometimes I have loopy dreams about space and they are still better than Interstellar.\n", "date": "10/05/2015 9:46am", "utime": "1444063587"}, {"text": "#1913 It's truly incredible how many people will not thank or even acknowledge you for holding the door open.

I want to anonymously address two comments there which addressed good points.\nOne asked if I felt that a womans value only came from her sexual history and willingness. The other asked why I was talking about the women and not the men involved. The reason I choose to address women is because I feel this is an issue that harms women the most. To the women here I will be completely honest with you. The harsh reality is, in our society you have very little power as a whole. Men hold most of it. Sex is one of the few areas you can say no to definitively. Power is the ability to say no. The second you give that up, you lose power. This is not going to change anytime soon. Men have sex for very different reasons then you do. Women for the most part see it as the beginning of developing an emotional bond. Men simply see it as a recreational activity. Sex may be an act of love and fun for women, but for men it's an act of power, control, recreation, and in some negative circumstances, violence. Men tend to get into relationships and marriage for regular guaranteed sex, not so much the emotional bonds that women get into relationships for.\nTo answer the question of the value of women, no a woman's intrinsic human value is not based on sexual history. Unfortunately for men, her value as a partner in a relationship is. And guilt tripping men trying to tell them to change millions of years of gut instinct is not going to help. What I am recommending to women is to wait for a committed relationship. You have to make your partner wait, treat you well, and value you, and work for you physically. People value scarcity. And the key to dealing with the power dynamic of sex is to get the guy to commit then get sex. That way even though you have submitted and relinquished sex, he has submitted and relinquished some of his freedom. That way even though you have given up the sexual power, he still respects you and treats you well.\n", "date": "09/23/2015 7:07am", "utime": "1443017245"}, {"text": "#1824 I'm a freshman and I feel like I'm struggling badly in all my classes and will never catch up...Does everyone feel like this at some point...\n", "date": "09/23/2015 7:07am", "utime": "1443017223"}, {"text": "#1819 I just want a roommate I can talk to about jerking off, lifting, and The Weeknd.

The reason it concerns me is how I'm honestly not sure how a lot of guys are going to be able to have normal relationships with one woman after getting Caligula style acts from various women. I'll admit it was really hard for me to settle down with one girl now.

I grew up in a relatively poor family, and my parents weren't friends with anybody, and they also didn't know(and therefore never taught me) any of the American social courtesies. Like, I never ever said \"thank you\" to anyone until middle school, when people started pointing out how rude I was to not say certain things.\nWhen I first started going to science camps in high school, I was really impressed with everyone and felt inferior to everyone. I met people who had already done research before, or who had done these science olympiads, or had built robots and stuff. But then I just kept hearing these recurring stories, like \"blah blah my parents knew this one guy and that's how I started research\" or \"blah blah my teacher got me started in this\" or even \"blah blah oh yeah my relative works in [insert college] admissions, so I'm not worried about getting in\" blah blah blah. Oh and also \u201cblah blah I found out about his camp because one of my friends went here.\u201d Lol I felt incredibly odd for being the only person who found camps by googling stuff with the keywords \u201cscience\u201d and \u201cfinancial assistance.\u201d I don't think those people even realize how privileged they are. To have even the smallest bit of guidance from somebody, or a nudge onto a path of success, or the tiniest bit of assurance that your life will turn out fine even if you do one thing wrong-- those are HUGE privileges.\nI find it so weird that had I not started googling things that one night when I felt too exhausted to do work, or started applying to those camps on a whim, I probably never would have even known what a tiny bubble I had been living in, and about the countless opportunities that other people took for granted. I probably never would have applied to MIT.\nNow that I\u2019m at MIT, I realize that I have become one of those privileged people, and that I have the opportunity to network if I so choose\u2014that some person would give something I say more consideration just because I go to MIT. And I hate the fact that door is open to me. I hate the fact that door is open to anyone.

And so has the response \"Fraternities are their own worst enemies, not Drunk Girls.\"\nI'm going to be brutally honest. I'm a girl, and I actually agreed with a lot of the things that Bill Frezza was talking about. He went a little overboard on points, but in light of the LCA incident and the frat ban now and last year, he was probably a bit worked up about everything and said things he probably regrets.\nOutside of MIT is a different story, but within our school, I believe that a lot of frats here really do try to follow the basic rules. Yeah, they're going to have alcohol, but when it comes to the serious situations of rape and sexual assault, the fraternity as a whole is not going to encourage and support those kinds of behavior. I think what Frezza was trying to say was that fraternities have control over themselves, but not their guests--and there's a larger consequence if something happens to a guest that is a female (which is a whole different topic). There's a potential for a lot of misunderstandings that could blow up into things that could bring down the frat.\nI'm not talking about sexual assault or rape cases. That's the fault of the person who committed those actions (but still not the fraternity as a whole). I'm talking about people who are intoxicated who make poor decisions because of their state and end up hurting themselves and blaming the frat. Most of us have been to a frat party. There's a lot of people to watch out for, and a situation like that is really hard to prevent. And unfortunately, the situation is a lot worse if that accident happens to a girl rather than a guy. Politically that's just how it is.\nAnd let's be honest, the response article was a dramatic, exaggeration of the LCA situation. \"an intoxicated girl 'danced out' a frat house window, thereby ruining the party.

We all joined greek life for some reason, and all greek life improves this school. There's no reason to shit on each other. To guys in PBE, congrats on a very exciting CPW weekend.

The sad thing about politicians as I keep noticing from one country to another, is that they don't seem to care much about humanity. their values are very close to only one community, not caring about the other communities- I mean, that's not a bad thing, as long as you remind your community that there is a bigger picture as well, and that all humans are worthy of your love. We are all one. This whole world, the people everywhere are all good, kind people. Some are misled, instead of hating them and giving way to hate, why don't we start trying to fix them. Teaching them to love. Not hating them back and judging them and not giving them second chances.\nIt's not Boston ONE. It's humans ONE (humans in Boston in our case)- it was the love for people that made those brave Bostonians reach out and help during that catastrophe, it was not the fact that they had to help the Bostonians. Tell me, did those brave Boston men and women ask \"Oh, where are you from?
