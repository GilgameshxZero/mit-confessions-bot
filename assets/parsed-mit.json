Nobody likes going to the mental hospital; my experience was also stressful but I also didn't kill myself and that's the whole point. Spending a few days in the hospital where you can just forget about everything else and be taken care of, even if it is scary and not great or you don't want to be there, it's worth it if you come out ok. Often, it's difficult for people to have an objective understanding of how bad the situation is. It's like waiting so long before asking for help that first time because you've convinced yourself that you're ok for so long - it takes a while to get through your anger and frustration before you can come to terms with the fact that maybe you did need to be there and that professionals don't send patients away willy nilly.\n", "src": "mit", "id": 13627, "nr-text": "i'm tired of all these \"i shouldn't have been hospitalized, they had no right to do this, don't seek help because you'll be sent to a mental hospital, etc\". first of all, if you're sent to the hospital it's because a professional believes that you cannot keep yourself safe and whether you expressed that to them or not, professionals are trained to recognize when the situation is getting out of hand. nobody likes going to the mental hospital; my experience was also stressful but i also didn't kill myself and that's the whole point. spending a few days in the hospital where you can just forget about everything else and be taken care of, even if it is scary and not great or you don't want to be there, it's worth it if you come out ok. often, it's difficult for people to have an objective understanding of how bad the situation is. it's like waiting so long before asking for help that first time because you've convinced yourself that you're ok for so long - it takes a while to get through your anger and frustration before you can come to terms with the fact that maybe you did need to be there and that professionals don't send patients away willy nilly.\n"}, {"text": "#13625 i beat my boi in a fart contest\n", "date": "05/16/2018 10:34am", "utime": 1526492040, "orig-text": "#13625 I beat my boi in a fart contest\n", "src": "mit", "id": 13625, "nr-text": "i beat my boi in a fart contest\n"}, {"text": "#13624 my girl is cute but she farts too much\n", "date": "05/16/2018 10:33am", "utime": 1526491980, "orig-text": "#13624 My girl is cute but she farts too much\n", "src": "mit", "id": 13624, "nr-text": "my girl is cute but she farts too much\n"}, {"text": "#13623 you are seriously one of the most beautiful and driven people i have ever met. i feel like you have never been loved deeply enough to see that in yourself, and i wish i could give that to you.\n", "date": "05/16/2018 10:33am", "utime": 1526491980, "orig-text": "#13623 you are seriously one of the most beautiful and driven people I have ever met.

Here's why, and this next part is going to sound rough, but I hope you read on beyond for my explanation: The fact is that I do consider some people to be more amazing than others, I mean that's only natural. That doesn't change the fact that everyone I've met here is amazing, but simply reflects the fact that we all have our own ideas of amazing. For example, the most amazing person that I know based on my standards of amazing is someone who always seems insecure/scared/inadequate for not having the best scores/stats/accomplishments but never fails to check in on a friend, which is a trait which I consider important enough to make them my most amazing. Similarly I've heard ppl consider someone who's gotten '200 top company job offers' (Clarification: That's intentional exaggeration) to be the most amazing. The point is that we are all so amazing that I guarantee that someone out there considers us to be their most amazing friend/acquaintance. Yet we are also so competitive, hell, we needed to be to get here, that we drown out that voice that considers us amazing and hear all the voices that consider us well, at worst, less amazing. Remember this quote:\n\"You are the most amazing person I've ever had the privilege of meeting\" -Someone, perhaps your best friend, your significant other, or someone you'll meet in the future, but I have no doubt someone has or will think this about you, and listen to them cause they're the ones who are actually right. I mean they're calling you the best person out of 7.1 billion people, which means you're pretty fucking amazing.\n", "src": "mit", "id": 2254, "nr-text": "i've probably met 100s of ppl here now and am still yet to meet even one who isn't amazing in some way. and yet for a place with the most amazing people i've ever met, this place does a helluva impressive job of making literally everyone feel the exact opposite way. here's why, and this next part is going to sound rough, but i hope you read on beyond for my explanation: the fact is that i do consider some people to be more amazing than others, i mean that's only natural. that doesn't change the fact that everyone i've met here is amazing, but simply reflects the fact that we all have our own ideas of amazing. for example, the most amazing person that i know based on my standards of amazing is someone who always seems insecure/scared/inadequate for not having the best scores/stats/accomplishments but never fails to check in on a friend, which is a trait which i consider important enough to make them my most amazing. similarly i've heard ppl consider someone who's gotten '200 top company job offers' (clarification: that's intentional exaggeration) to be the most amazing. the point is that we are all so amazing that i guarantee that someone out there considers us to be their most amazing friend/acquaintance. yet we are also so competitive, hell, we needed to be to get here, that we drown out that voice that considers us amazing and hear all the voices that consider us well, at worst, less amazing. remember this quote:\n\"you are the most amazing person i've ever had the privilege of meeting\" -someone, perhaps your best friend, your significant other, or someone you'll meet in the future, but i have no doubt someone has or will think this about you, and listen to them cause they're the ones who are actually right. i mean they're calling you the best person out of 7.1 billion people, which means you're pretty fucking amazing.\n"}, {"text": "#2253 6.01 is actually whipping my ass this semester.\n", "date": "10/26/2015 6:45pm", "utime": 1445910354, "orig-text": "#2253 6.01 is actually whipping my ass this semester.\n", "src": "mit", "id": 2253, "nr-text": "6.01 is actually whipping my ass this semester.\n"}, {"text": "#2250 i seriously don't understand septum piercings. when you have a cold doesn't it get all buggery? who would want that?\n", "date": "10/26/2015 6:45pm", "utime": 1445910318, "orig-text": "#2250 I seriously don't understand septum piercings.
